# Project Prometheus: Multi-Agent Cognitive Emergence System

**Date**: November 01, 2025
**Status**: Approved Design Plan
**Timeline**: 3-4 months
**Budget**: ~$30 total

---

## Vision

Transform the current single evolutionary algorithm into a multi-agent AI civilization where **cognitive emergence** occurs - collective intelligence that fundamentally exceeds individual agent capabilities.

**Ultimate Goal**: "認知的創発 (Cognitive Emergence)" - Individual LLM agents' abilities fundamentally transcend simple summation, creating a new dimension of problem-finding and problem-solving capability.

---

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: MVP - Dual Agent (2 weeks, <$1)

**Goal**: Test core hypothesis with simplest possible system

**Implementation**:
1. Create `CognitiveCell` class with triple memory architecture (episodic, semantic, working)
2. Implement `SimpleCommunicationChannel` for message passing
3. Extend `FactorizationCrucible` for multi-agent evaluation
4. Build two complementary agents:
   - **Agent A**: Search specialist (good at finding candidates)
   - **Agent B**: Evaluation specialist (good at assessing smoothness)

**Hypothesis H1**: Two communicating agents outperform two independent agents
- **Test**: 10 runs × 10 generations (collaborative vs baseline)
- **Success Criteria**: p<0.05, Cohen's d≥0.5, emergence_factor>1.1
- **Cost**: $0.50 (600 API calls)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: Proceed to Phase 2 only if H1 confirmed

---

### Phase 2: Small Group (4 weeks, <$20)

**Goal**: Test specialization and protocol emergence

**Implementation**:
1. Scale to 5 agents with role diversity
2. Add network topology (small-world graph)
3. Implement bandwidth limits and message costs
4. Add `EmergenceDetector` for automatic detection

**Hypotheses**:
- **H2**: Specialization emerges (expertise variance increases)
- **H3**: Novel protocols invented (beyond training data)

**Cost**: $5 (5,000 API calls)

**Go/No-Go Decision**: Proceed to Phase 3 if emergence indicators confirmed

---

### Phase 3: Civilization (7 weeks, <$100)

**Goal**: Validate cognitive emergence at scale

**Implementation**:
1. Scale to 20 agents with full heterogeneity
2. Dynamic environments (changing targets)
3. Reputation systems and reciprocity norms
4. Comprehensive emergence metrics suite

**Hypotheses**:
- **H4**: Collective reasoning (agents build on each other's ideas)
- **H5**: Scale-up benefit (20 agents > 5 agents)

**Success Criteria**: EmergenceDetector.score>0.7, novel discoveries documented

**Cost**: $25 (30,000 API calls)

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Memory Systems (Enable Learning Without Forgetting)

Three-tier architecture inspired by human cognition:

- **Episodic Memory**: Recent interactions (circular buffer, 100 entries)
  - "What happened?" - Stores interaction traces for replay/learning
  - Enables reflection on past experiences

- **Semantic Memory**: Learned knowledge (vector store, searchable)
  - "What do I know?" - Distilled knowledge, searchable via embeddings
  - Persistent across generations

- **Working Memory**: Current context (token budget management, ~4K tokens)
  - "What am I thinking?" - Current context passed to LLM
  - Priority: goal > recent messages > relevant knowledge

**Critical Pattern**: Memory systems prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining focused attention.

---

### 2. Communication Architecture (Force Asymmetry)

**Core Insight**: Asymmetric information flow is critical for emergence. Full information → homogenization.

**Design Principles**:

1. **Network Topology** (not broadcast)
   - Small-world networks (Watts-Strogatz model)
   - Agents see neighbors, not all agents
   - Enables local clusters + global reach

2. **Bandwidth Constraints** (forces prioritization)
   - Limited messages per timestep (e.g., 10)
   - Agents must choose what to communicate
   - Creates information asymmetry → specialization

3. **Latency** (enables temporal dynamics)
   - Message delivery delay (~0.1s simulated)
   - Prevents instant coordination (too easy)
   - Rewards predictive models

4. **Cost** (economic pressure)
   - Communication consumes resources
   - Incentivizes efficient protocols
   - Enables game-theoretic dynamics

5. **Protocols** (structured interaction)
   - Defined message schemas (Request, Response, Assertion, Query)
   - Prevents semantic drift ("tower of babel" problem)
   - Enables analysis (can measure protocol evolution)

---

### 3. Emergence Conditions

**Theoretical Requirements** (from complex systems theory):

1. **Heterogeneity** (diverse components)
   - Different roles: Specialist, Generalist, Coordinator
   - Different models: Gemini Flash (50%), Pro (30%), Claude Haiku (20%)
   - Prevents lock-in to local optima

2. **Local Interaction** (not global broadcast)
   - Network topology with limited radius
   - Enables spatial patterns, clustering
   - O(N×k) complexity instead of O(N²)

3. **Environmental Feedback** (external pressure)
   - Shared problem requiring coordination
   - Collective fitness (70%) + individual fitness (30%)
   - Rewards cooperation while maintaining competition

4. **Memory & Learning** (temporal depth)
   - Triple memory architecture
   - Agents adapt based on experience
   - Learning curves tracked at individual + collective levels

5. **Non-Linear Interactions** (complex dynamics)
   - Reputation systems (trust network)
   - Reciprocity norms (anti-free-riding)
   - Feedback loops amplify useful behaviors

6. **Moderate Coupling** (Goldilocks zone)
   - Too loose: No coordination emerges
   - Too tight: System acts as single agent
   - Tunable: bandwidth, latency, message cost

---

### 4. Safety & Observability

#### Sandboxing Strategy

**Threat Model**:
- Harmful strategies (crash system)
- Resource exhaustion (infinite loops, API abuse)
- Information leakage (access to secrets)
- Emergent deception (gaming metrics)
- Cascading failures (error propagation)

**Mitigation**:
```python
class SafeExecutionSandbox:
    max_execution_time = 30.0  # seconds
    max_memory_mb = 512
    max_api_calls_per_agent = 100
    allowed_modules = {"math", "random", "itertools"}  # Whitelist
    forbidden_keys = {"api_key", "secret", "password"}
```

#### Monitoring & Observability

**InteractionLogger**: Comprehensive logging of all agent interactions
- Every message sent/received
- Strategy proposals with reasoning traces
- Evaluation results with detailed metrics
- Interaction network graphs
- Anomaly detection (message loops, silent agents, convergence)

#### Emergency Stop Mechanisms

**Circuit Breakers**:
- API cost limit ($100 max)
- Strategy failure rate (>50% → rollback)
- Message storm detection (>100 msg/sec → throttle)
- Loss of diversity (<0.1 → inject random agents)

### Statistical Rigor

**Pre-Registration**:
- Document all hypotheses before running experiments
- Specify success criteria (p-values, effect sizes)
- Define data handling procedures

**Statistical Tests**:
- Welch's t-test (unequal variances)
- Cohen's d effect sizes (small: 0.2-0.5, medium: 0.5-0.8, large: >0.8)
- 95% Confidence Intervals
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α/n)

**Reproducibility**:
- Seed-based determinism (same seed → same outcome)
- Version control all code
- Document exact LLM models and parameters
- Archive all experiment results

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Major Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **No Emergence** | 30% | Medium | Start with MVP ($0.50), publish negative result, pivot to meta-learning |
| **API Cost Overrun** | 15% | Low | Hard cost limits in code, early stopping, cheaper models |
| **Technical Complexity** | 40% | Medium | TDD, comprehensive testing, incremental development |
| **Intractability** | 20% | Medium | Extensive logging, visualization, simplified metrics |

### Failure Modes & Solutions

1. **Convergence to Trivial Behaviors** (all agents do same thing)
   - Solution: Network topology, diversity injection, niche rewards

2. **Combinatorial Explosion** (too many interactions)
   - Solution: Bandwidth limits, bounded memory, network topology

3. **Agent Hallucination Cascades** (errors propagate)
   - Solution: Skepticism parameters, empirical verification, cross-validation

4. **No Emergence Despite Complexity** (interactions but no emergent behaviors)
   - Solution: Force cooperation (collective fitness), complementary roles, difficult problems

5. **Computational Intractability** (too slow/expensive)
   - Solution: Early stopping, parallelization, adaptive population, checkpointing

### Why It Might Work

✅ **Strong theoretical foundation** (complex systems, evolutionary algorithms)
✅ **Excellent infrastructure** (359 tests, metrics, config system)
✅ **Conservative staged approach** (fail fast, iterate)
✅ **Low cost/risk for MVP** (<$1, 2 weeks)
✅ **Clear hypotheses** with statistical validation
✅ **Upside potential** enormous (cognitive emergence = paradigm shift)

## Resource Requirements

### Cost Breakdown

| Phase | API Calls | Cost | Duration |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| Phase 1 (MVP) | 600 | $0.50 | 2 weeks |
| Phase 2 (Small Group) | 5,000 | $5.00 | 4 weeks |
| Phase 3 (Civilization) | 30,000 | $25.00 | 7 weeks |
| **Total** | **35,600** | **~$30** | **13 weeks** |

**Cost Calculation**:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite: $0.10/M input, $0.40/M output
- Average: 2K tokens input, 500 tokens output
- Per call: ~$0.0006
- Total: 35,600 × $0.0006 ≈ $21.36 (rounded to $30 with buffer)

### Compute Requirements

- **Memory**: 2-3GB RAM (50MB per agent × 20 agents + logs)
- **CPU**: Evaluation is CPU-bound, LLM calls are I/O (parallelizable)
- **Storage**: ~1GB (logs, checkpoints, visualizations)
- **Bottleneck**: API rate limits, not compute

### Timeline

```
Week 1-2:   Phase 1 Implementation + Experiments
Week 3-6:   Phase 2 Implementation + Experiments + Analysis
Week 7-13:  Phase 3 Implementation + Experiments + Analysis + Writeup

Total: 13 weeks (3-4 months part-time)
```

        return messages
```

## Recommendation

**✅ START WITH PHASE 1 MVP** - 2 weeks, <$1, low risk

**Rationale**:
- **Low risk**: $0.50, 2 weeks, reuses 60% of existing code
- **Clear testable hypothesis**: H1 (collaboration > independence)
- **Natural extension**: Builds on current evolutionary algorithm + LLM work
- **Even null result is valuable**: Validates or refutes emergence hypothesis
- **Upside potential is enormous**: Cognitive emergence = paradigm shift in AI research

**Strategic Value**:
- If successful: Foundation for groundbreaking multi-agent AI research
- If unsuccessful: Valuable negative result + pivot to validated meta-learning (Option A)
- Either outcome: Publishable results demonstrating scientific rigor
