## 1. Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Primary Research Question
**"Can LLM-guided evolutionary algorithms discover better GNFS sieving heuristics than rule-based genetic algorithms?"**

### Formal Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 1: LLM vs Rule-Based Evolution
- **H₀** (Null): μ_LLM ≤ μ_RuleBased (LLM produces equal or worse fitness)
- **H₁** (Alternative): μ_LLM > μ_RuleBased (LLM produces superior fitness)
- **α** (Significance level): 0.05 (one-tailed test)
- **Power**: 0.80 (probability of detecting true effect)
- **Expected effect size**: Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 (medium effect)

#### Hypothesis 2: Evolution vs Classical Baselines
- **H₀**: μ_Evolved ≤ max(μ_Conservative, μ_Balanced, μ_Aggressive)
- **H₁**: μ_Evolved > max(μ_Conservative, μ_Balanced, μ_Aggressive)
- **α**: 0.05 (one-tailed test, Bonferroni-corrected for 3 comparisons: α/3 = 0.0167)
- **Expected effect size**: Cohen's d ≥ 0.8 (large effect)

#### Hypothesis 3: Meta-Learning Benefit
- **H₀**: μ_Adaptive ≤ μ_Fixed (Adaptive rates don't improve performance)
- **H₁**: μ_Adaptive > μ_Fixed (Adaptive rates improve performance)
- **α**: 0.05 (one-tailed test)
- **Expected effect size**: Cohen's d ≥ 0.3 (small effect acceptable for meta-learning)

### Secondary Research Questions
1. **Convergence speed**: Do LLM-guided runs converge faster than rule-based runs?
2. **Strategy diversity**: Do evolved strategies discover novel parameter combinations?
3. **Cost-effectiveness**: Is LLM API cost justified by fitness improvement?
4. **Operator contribution**: Which reproduction operator (crossover/mutation/random) produces most elite offspring?

---

## 2. Experimental Design

### Design Type
**Repeated Measures Factorial Design** with:
- **Between-subjects factors**: Evolution mode (LLM vs Rule-based)
- **Within-subjects factors**: Baseline comparison (Conservative vs Balanced vs Aggressive)
- **Repeated trials**: 15-30 independent runs per condition

### Why This Design?
1. **Repeated trials** account for stochastic variation in evolutionary algorithms
2. **Within-subjects baselines** reduce inter-run variance
3. **Between-subjects evolution mode** prevents contamination between LLM and rule-based strategies
4. **Factorial structure** allows testing interaction effects (future work)

### Experimental Conditions

#### Phase 1: Quick Validation (Pilot Study)
**Purpose**: Establish proof-of-concept before full experiments

| Condition | Runs | Generations | Population | Duration | Est. Cost |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Rule-based | 10 | 20 | 20 | 0.5s | $0 |
| LLM-guided | 5 | 15 | 15 | 0.5s | $0.10-0.20 |

**Success criteria**: LLM shows positive signal (p<0.2 or d>0.3)

#### Phase 3: Full Validation (Confirmatory Study)
**Purpose**: Establish statistical significance with adequate power

| Condition | Runs | Generations | Population | Duration | Est. Cost |
|-----------|------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Rule-based | 30 | 30 | 30 | 1.0s | $0 |
| LLM-guided | 15 | 30 | 30 | 1.0s | $1.50-2.00 |
| LLM + Meta | 10 | 30 | 30 | 1.0s | $1.00-1.50 |

**Total estimated cost**: $2.50-3.50 (well under $20 budget)

## 3. Parameter Selection Justification

### Population Size: 20-30 Strategies
**Rationale**:
- Genetic algorithm literature recommends 10-100 for diversity vs compute tradeoff
- GNFS strategy space has 5 parameters × discrete values = ~10,000 unique combinations
- Population 20-30 samples <1% of space, forcing exploration via mutation/crossover
- Pilot data (metrics/test_run.json) showed fitness improvement with population=3, suggesting 20-30 sufficient

**Alternative considered**: Population=50-100 (rejected due to compute time: 3x longer)

### Generations: 20-30 Cycles
**Rationale**:
- Convergence detection (variance threshold 0.05, window=5) typically triggers at gen 10-15
- Extra 10-15 generations confirm plateau, prevent premature stopping
- Pilot data showed improvement 0→55→1,228 in 2 generations, suggesting 20-30 captures full trajectory

**Alternative considered**: Generations=50-100 (rejected: overkill if convergence at gen 15)

### Evaluation Duration: 0.5-1.0s per Strategy
**Rationale**:
- Timing analysis (tests/test_timing_accuracy.py) shows 50-100ms minimum for stable measurements
- 500ms-1000ms reduces variance while keeping total runtime feasible
- Trade-off: Longer duration = more stable fitness, but 10x duration = 10x total runtime

**Scaling**:
- 0.5s: 10 runs × 20 gen × 20 pop × 0.5s = 33 min
- 1.0s: 30 runs × 30 gen × 30 pop × 1.0s = 450 min = 7.5 hours

### Baseline Strategies: Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive
**Rationale**:
- **Conservative** (power=2, 3 filters, hits=4): Emulates cautious GNFS approach, low false positives
- **Balanced** (power=3, 2 filters, hits=2): Emulates typical GNFS default parameters
- **Aggressive** (power=4, 1 filter, hits=1): Emulates high-throughput approach, high recall

**Validation**: All three deterministic, validate on construction (src/comparison.py:66-95)

**Alternative considered**: Random baselines (rejected: need meaningful comparison points)

## 4. Statistical Power Analysis

### Sample Size Calculation

**For Hypothesis 1 (LLM vs Rule-Based)**:

Using G*Power 3.1 parameters:
- **Test**: Two-sample t-test (one-tailed)
- **Effect size**: d = 0.5 (medium effect, conservative estimate)
- **α**: 0.05
- **Power**: 0.80

**Required sample size per group**: n ≥ 50 (for independent samples t-test)

**Our study**: n_RuleBased = 30, n_LLM = 15
- **Achieved power**: ~0.65 for d=0.5 (acceptable for pilot study)
- **Detectable effect size at power=0.80**: d ≥ 0.70 (medium-to-large)

**Interpretation**: This study can reliably detect medium-to-large effects (d≥0.7), but may miss small effects (d<0.5). Acceptable for proof-of-concept where we expect d>0.8 if LLM truly helps.

### Multiple Comparison Correction

**Bonferroni correction** for 3 baseline comparisons:
- **Family-wise error rate**: α_FWER = 0.05
- **Per-comparison threshold**: α_PC = 0.05 / 3 = 0.0167

**Conservative approach**: Protects against false positives when testing multiple baselines simultaneously.

**Alternative considered**: False Discovery Rate (FDR) control via Benjamini-Hochberg (less conservative, not needed for only 3 comparisons)

---

## 5. Pre-Registered Analysis Plan

### Primary Analysis

**Step 1: Descriptive Statistics**
For each condition (Rule-based, LLM, LLM+Meta):
- Mean fitness (μ) across all runs
- Standard deviation (σ)
- Min, Max, Median
- 95% Confidence Interval: μ ± 1.96(σ/√n)

**Step 2: Normality Testing**
- Shapiro-Wilk test for normality (p>0.05 indicates normal distribution)
- If non-normal: Report medians and use Welch's t-test (robust to non-normality)

**Step 3: Hypothesis Testing**

For **Hypothesis 1** (LLM vs Rule-Based):
```python
# Using StatisticalAnalyzer from src/statistics.py
result = StatisticalAnalyzer().compare_fitness_distributions(
    evolved_scores=[final_fitness for run in llm_runs],
    baseline_scores=[final_fitness for run in rulebased_runs]
)
# Returns: p_value, effect_size (Cohen's d), confidence_interval, significance
```

**Decision rule**:
- If p < 0.05 AND d ≥ 0.5: **Reject H₀**, conclude LLM significantly better
- If p < 0.05 AND d < 0.5: **Reject H₀**, but effect too small for practical significance
- If p ≥ 0.05: **Fail to reject H₀**, insufficient evidence for LLM benefit

For **Hypothesis 2** (Evolved vs Baselines):
```python
# Test against each baseline separately with Bonferroni correction
for baseline_name in ["conservative", "balanced", "aggressive"]:
    result = StatisticalAnalyzer().compare_fitness_distributions(
        evolved_scores=[final_fitness for run in evolved_runs],
        baseline_scores=[baseline_fitness[baseline_name] for run in evolved_runs]
    )
    # Apply Bonferroni: reject H₀ only if p < 0.0167
```

**Decision rule**:
- If p < 0.0167 for ALL three baselines: **Strong evidence** evolution beats classical heuristics
- If p < 0.0167 for 2/3 baselines: **Moderate evidence** evolution helps
- If p < 0.0167 for 1/3 baselines: **Weak evidence**, investigate why some baselines harder

### Secondary Analyses

**Convergence Speed** (Hypothesis 3):
```python
# Using ConvergenceDetector from src/statistics.py
detector = ConvergenceDetector(window_size=5, threshold=0.05)
generations_to_converge_llm = [detector.generations_to_convergence(run.evolved_fitness)
                                for run in llm_runs]
generations_to_converge_rule = [detector.generations_to_convergence(run.evolved_fitness)
                                 for run in rulebased_runs]

# Compare via t-test
# H₀: μ_gen_LLM ≥ μ_gen_RuleBased (LLM takes longer or equal)
# H₁: μ_gen_LLM < μ_gen_RuleBased (LLM converges faster)
```

**Operator Contribution**:
```python
# Analyze operator_history from metrics export (if meta-learning enabled)
# For each operator (crossover, mutation, random):
#   - Success rate = elite_offspring / total_offspring
#   - Compare across LLM vs rule-based modes
```

**Cost-Effectiveness** (LLM only):
```python
# From LLM runs
total_cost = sum(run.config.llm_cost for run in llm_runs)
fitness_gain = mean_fitness_llm - mean_fitness_rulebased
roi = fitness_gain / total_cost  # fitness improvement per dollar
```

## 6. Effect Size Interpretation Guidelines

Following **Cohen (1988)** standards:

| Cohen's d | Interpretation | Real-world Meaning (for this study) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| d < 0.2 | Negligible | LLM improvement barely noticeable |
| 0.2 ≤ d < 0.5 | Small | LLM finds ~20% more smooth numbers |
| 0.5 ≤ d < 0.8 | Medium | LLM finds ~50% more smooth numbers |
| d ≥ 0.8 | Large | LLM finds ≥80% more smooth numbers |

**Practical Significance Threshold**: d ≥ 0.5 (medium effect)

**Rationale**: Small effects (d<0.5) unlikely to justify LLM API costs for production use. Medium-to-large effects (d≥0.5) demonstrate clear practical benefit.

## 7. Data Handling Procedures

### Outlier Detection
**Method**: Interquartile Range (IQR) rule
- Calculate Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outliers: Values < Q1 - 1.5×IQR or > Q3 + 1.5×IQR

**Action**:
- Report outliers separately
- Run analyses with and without outliers
- If results differ substantially, investigate cause (e.g., RNG seed issue, convergence failure)

**Pre-registered decision**: Do NOT remove outliers unless proven to be data collection errors (e.g., process killed mid-run)

### Missing Data
**Expected causes**:
- Run fails to converge (detector returns None)
- Process crashes mid-run
- API timeout (LLM mode only)

**Handling**:
- Report N_valid / N_total for each condition
- If >10% missing data: Investigate systematically, report as limitation
- Do NOT impute missing fitness values (too much uncertainty)

### Data Archival
All raw result files stored in `results/` directory with naming convention:
- `{mode}_run_{seed}.json` (e.g., `llm_run_2000.json`)
- Includes full config, metrics_history, operator_history
- Git-ignored for privacy, but archived separately for reproducibility

---

## 8. Reproducibility Measures

### Random Seed Management
**Seeds for Phase 1**:
- Rule-based: seeds 42-51 (10 runs)
- LLM: seeds 100-104 (5 runs)

**Seeds for Phase 3**:
- Rule-based: seeds 1000-1029 (30 runs)
- LLM: seeds 2000-2014 (15 runs)
- LLM+Meta: seeds 3000-3009 (10 runs)

**Rationale**: Non-overlapping ranges prevent accidental duplication. Documented in advance for transparency.

### Environment Specification
**Python version**: 3.9+ (CI tests on 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
**Key dependencies**:
- `google-genai>=0.2.0` (LLM API)
- `scipy>=1.9.0` (statistical tests)
- `pydantic>=2.0.0` (schema validation)

**Hardware**: Apple Silicon M-series (macOS), 16GB+ RAM recommended

**Reproducibility verification**:
- Same seed should produce identical initial population
- Same seed should produce identical mutation/crossover decisions
- Fitness may vary slightly (<5%) due to timing-based evaluation (acceptable)

---

## 9. Ethical Considerations

### Compute Resource Use
**Estimated compute**:
- Phase 1: ~1-2 hours (pilot)
- Phase 3: ~10-15 hours (full validation)
- **Total**: ~15-20 hours on single machine

**Carbon footprint**: Minimal (single-machine experiment, no GPU training)

### LLM API Usage
**Estimated API calls**: ~1,000-2,000 total
**Cost**: ~$3-5 (well within free tier for Gemini Flash Lite)
**Data privacy**: No user data sent to LLM, only fitness scores and strategy parameters

### Research Integrity
**Pre-registration**: This document written BEFORE full Phase 3 experiments
**Transparency**: All code open-source, results to be shared publicly
**Negative results**: Will report if LLM does NOT help (scientifically valuable)

## 10. Limitations & Threats to Validity

### Internal Validity Threats
1. **Selection bias**: Initial population random, but could favor certain strategy types
   - *Mitigation*: Large population (20-30), multiple runs (15-30)

2. **Instrumentation**: Fitness evaluation timing-dependent, not deterministic
   - *Mitigation*: Longer duration (0.5-1.0s) reduces variance, multiple runs average out noise

3. **Maturation**: Strategies may improve due to random drift, not true evolution
   - *Mitigation*: Baseline comparison shows evolution outperforms random search

### External Validity Threats
1. **Generalization to other numbers**: Only tested on N=961730063
   - *Mitigation*: Document this limitation, suggest future work on multiple N values

2. **Generalization to real GNFS**: Simplified sieving simulation, not full NFS
   - *Mitigation*: Acknowledge in discussion, position as proof-of-concept

3. **LLM model dependency**: Results specific to Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
   - *Mitigation*: Document model version, suggest future work on other LLMs

### Statistical Conclusion Validity Threats
1. **Low power**: n=15 for LLM (power ~0.65 for d=0.5)
   - *Mitigation*: Focus on large effects (d≥0.7), report confidence intervals

2. **Multiple comparisons**: Testing 3 baselines inflates Type I error
   - *Mitigation*: Bonferroni correction (α/3 = 0.0167)

3. **Violated assumptions**: Normality, homogeneity of variance
   - *Mitigation*: Use Welch's t-test (robust to violations), report non-parametric tests if needed
