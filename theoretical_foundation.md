## 1. Background: The General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)

### 1.1 Integer Factorization Problem

**Problem Statement**: Given a composite integer N, find its prime factors p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ such that N = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × ... × pₖ^aₖ.

**Computational Complexity**:
- **Best classical algorithm**: General Number Field Sieve (GNFS)
- **Time complexity**: exp(∛(64/9 × ln(N) × (ln ln(N))²)) ≈ L_N[1/3, ∛(64/9)]
- **Subexponential**: Faster than trial division (O(√N)) but slower than polynomial algorithms
- **Practical limit**: 829-bit RSA-250 factored in 2700 CPU-years (2020)

**Why It Matters**:
- RSA cryptography security relies on factorization hardness
- Post-quantum migration requires understanding current capabilities
- GNFS performance directly impacts cryptanalysis timelines

### 1.2 GNFS Algorithm Overview

The General Number Field Sieve consists of four main phases:

#### Phase 1: Polynomial Selection
Choose two irreducible polynomials f(x), g(x) with common root m (mod N).

**Criterion**: Small coefficients, small resultant for efficient relation finding.

#### Phase 2: Sieving (COMPUTATIONALLY DOMINANT)
Find pairs (a, b) such that both:
- a - b×m is "smooth" over rational factor base
- f(a/b) is "smooth" over algebraic factor base

**Smoothness**: A number is B-smooth if all its prime factors are ≤ B.

**Computational cost**: 90-95% of total GNFS runtime spent here.

**Search space size**: Typically 10¹⁰-10¹⁵ candidates for 512-1024 bit numbers.

#### Phase 3: Linear Algebra
Construct matrix from smooth relations, find null space via block Lanczos/Wiedemann.

**Cost**: O(n²) where n = number of relations (millions to billions).

#### Phase 4: Square Root
Compute algebraic and rational square roots to extract factors.

**Cost**: Negligible compared to sieving.

### 1.3 Sieving Step Deep Dive

**Naive approach** (trial division):
```python
for a in range(-M, M):
    for b in range(1, M):
        candidate = a - b * m
        if is_smooth(candidate, smoothness_bound):
            store_relation(a, b)
```
**Problem**: is_smooth() via trial division is O(√N) per candidate, infeasible for large search spaces.

**Optimized approach** (lattice sieving):
1. **Modulus filtering**: Quick rejection via residue classes
   - If N ≡ r (mod p), only check candidates ≡ r (mod p)
   - Eliminates ~50% of candidates per small prime filter

2. **Special-Q lattice**: Restrict search to sublattice where q | (a - b×m)
   - Reduces search space by factor of q

3. **Batch sieving**: Use sieve of Eratosthenes-like approach
   - Mark candidates divisible by each prime in factor base
   - Only trial-divide candidates with many marks

**This study focuses on**: Discovering optimal modulus filtering strategies via evolution.

## 2. Why Evolutionary Algorithms for GNFS Optimization?

### 2.1 Fitness Landscape Characteristics

The GNFS parameter space exhibits several properties amenable to evolutionary search:

**1. Large discrete search space**:
- Power p ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}: Polynomial degree
- Modulus filters: Choose from dozens of small primes {2,3,5,7,11,...,31}
- Residue classes: For modulus m, choose subset of {0,1,...,m-1}
- Smoothness bound: Choose from {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31}
- Min hits: Integer in range {1,2,3,4,5,6}

**Total combinations**: 4 × C(10,4) × 2^(sum of moduli) × 11 × 6 ≈ 10⁷-10⁹ unique strategies

**Implication**: Too large for exhaustive search, but small enough that random sampling finds diverse starting points.

**2. Rugged fitness landscape with local optima**:
- Changing power from 3→4 can drastically change fitness (discontinuous)
- Adding/removing modulus filter creates discrete jumps
- But neighboring strategies (similar parameters) often have correlated fitness

**Implication**: Local search (mutation) can hill-climb, but benefits from crossover to escape local optima.

**3. No closed-form fitness function**:
- Cannot analytically compute "number of smooth candidates" for given parameters
- Must empirically evaluate via simulation (candidate generation + smoothness testing)

**Implication**: Evolutionary algorithms ideal for black-box optimization problems.

**4. Fitness evaluation is stochastic**:
- Depends on random sampling of candidate space
- Timing-limited (fixed duration per evaluation)
- Multiple evaluations of same strategy yield different fitness (±5% variance observed)

**Implication**: Requires multiple trials and statistical validation to distinguish true improvements from noise.

### 2.2 Prior Work: Evolutionary Optimization for Factorization

**Genetic algorithms for NFS parameter tuning**:
- Kleinjung et al. (2010): Evolved polynomial selection parameters for RSA-768
- Bai et al. (2016): Genetic programming for sieving strategies in GNFS
- Result: 10-15% speedup over hand-tuned defaults

**Limitations of prior work**:
1. **Human-designed mutation operators**: Required domain expertise to define meaningful parameter changes
2. **Fixed crossover strategies**: Simple one-point or uniform crossover, not problem-adapted
3. **No semantic understanding**: Mutations random, no reasoning about why certain changes help

**Our contribution**: Use LLM to provide semantic reasoning for mutations, potentially discovering non-obvious parameter interactions.

## 3. Why Expect LLM-Guided Evolution to Outperform Rule-Based?

### 3.1 Hypothesis: LLMs as Heuristic Generators

**Core idea**: Large language models trained on diverse text corpora may have implicit knowledge about:
1. **Numerical patterns**: Relationships between prime numbers, modular arithmetic
2. **Optimization strategies**: General heuristics for search space exploration
3. **Meta-learning**: Adapting strategy based on fitness trajectory (exploration vs exploitation)

**Evidence from literature**:
- Brown et al. (2020, GPT-3): Few-shot learning on arithmetic tasks without fine-tuning
- Wei et al. (2022, Chain-of-Thought): LLMs improve on reasoning tasks when explaining solutions
- Wang et al. (2023, Self-Consistency): Multiple LLM samples improve optimization quality

**Proposed mechanism**:
1. **Pattern recognition**: LLM observes fitness history [fit₀, fit₁, fit₂, ...] and current strategy params
2. **Semantic reasoning**: Generates natural language explanation of why certain mutations may help
3. **Structured output**: Returns JSON mutation (e.g., `{"mutation_type": "add_filter", "modulus": 7, "residues": [0,2,5]}`)

### 3.2 Expected Advantages Over Rule-Based Mutation

| Aspect | Rule-Based Mutation | LLM-Guided Mutation |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Exploration** | Uniform random parameter changes | Can prioritize underexplored regions based on reasoning |
| **Exploitation** | No fitness-aware tuning | Can make smaller tweaks when near optimum |
| **Diversity** | May get stuck in local optima | Can suggest "creative" mutations to escape plateaus |
| **Parameter interactions** | Independent mutation per param | Can reason about correlated changes (e.g., "increase power AND loosen filters") |
| **Temperature control** | N/A | Built-in: high temp early (exploration), low temp late (exploitation) |

**Example scenario**:
- **Rule-based**: Random mutation changes power 3→4, breaks previously good strategy (fitness drops)
- **LLM-guided**: Observes "fitness plateaued for 3 generations", suggests "reduce smoothness bound to compensate for power increase", maintains fitness

### 3.3 Testable Predictions

If LLM-guided evolution truly outperforms rule-based, we expect:

**Prediction 1**: Higher final fitness
- **H₁**: μ_LLM > μ_RuleBased (primary hypothesis)
- **Mechanism**: Better exploration-exploitation balance

**Prediction 2**: Faster convergence
- **H₁**: generations_to_converge_LLM < generations_to_converge_RuleBased
- **Mechanism**: More informed mutations reduce wasted evaluations

**Prediction 3**: More diverse elite strategies
- **H₁**: parameter_diversity_LLM > parameter_diversity_RuleBased
- **Mechanism**: LLM suggests varied approaches, not just local hill-climbing

**Prediction 4**: Fitness trajectory smoothness
- **H₁**: variance(Δfitness)_LLM < variance(Δfitness)_RuleBased
- **Mechanism**: LLM avoids drastic destructive mutations

## 4. Strategy Design Space & Parameter Interactions

### 4.1 Strategy Representation

A GNFS sieving strategy is defined by 5 parameters:

```python
@dataclass
class Strategy:
    power: int                    # Polynomial degree (2-5)
    modulus_filters: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]]  # [(mod, [residues]), ...]
    smoothness_bound: int         # Max prime factor to check
    min_small_prime_hits: int     # Required count of small factors
```

**Example strategy**:
```python
Strategy(
    power=3,
    modulus_filters=[(7, [0, 2, 5]), (31, [0, 12, 14, 29])],
    smoothness_bound=19,
    min_small_prime_hits=2
)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Generate candidates via `x³ - N`
- Only check if `x ≡ 0,2,5 (mod 7)` AND `x ≡ 0,12,14,29 (mod 31)`
- Test divisibility by primes ≤ 19
- Require at least 2 small prime divisors to count as "smooth"

### 4.2 Parameter Interaction Effects

**Power ↔ Modulus Filters**:
- Higher power → More candidates generated → Need stronger filters to compensate
- Lower power → Fewer candidates → Can afford looser filters
- **Implication**: Optimal filter count depends on power choice

**Smoothness Bound ↔ Min Hits**:
- Higher bound → More primes to check → Slower evaluation → Find more smooth numbers
- Higher min_hits → Stricter threshold → Fewer smooth numbers
- **Implication**: Trade-off between quality (smoothness) and quantity (candidates)

**Modulus Filters ↔ Smoothness Bound**:
- Strong filters (many moduli) → Pre-reject most candidates → Can afford higher bound (less work per candidate)
- Weak filters (few moduli) → Many candidates pass → Need lower bound for speed
- **Implication**: Filter design impacts optimal smoothness bound

### 4.3 Example Optimization Trajectories

**Case 1: Rule-Based Evolution (observed in pilot data)**:
```
Gen 0: Strategy(power=2, filters=[(3,[0,1])], bound=7, hits=3)  → fitness=0
       ↓ (random mutation: power 2→3)
Gen 1: Strategy(power=3, filters=[(3,[0,1])], bound=7, hits=3)  → fitness=55
       ↓ (random mutation: add filter (7,[0,2,5]))
Gen 2: Strategy(power=3, filters=[(3,[0,1]),(7,[0,2,5])], bound=7, hits=3) → fitness=1228
```
**Analysis**: Stumbled upon good power, then lucky filter addition. No reasoning about why this worked.

**Case 2: Hypothetical LLM-Guided Evolution**:
```
Gen 0: Strategy(power=2, filters=[(3,[0,1])], bound=7, hits=3) → fitness=0
       ↓ (LLM reasoning: "No candidates likely due to overly strict hits=3 with small bound.
            Suggest: reduce hits to 1 to increase recall, then tune later.")
Gen 1: Strategy(power=2, filters=[(3,[0,1])], bound=7, hits=1) → fitness=800
       ↓ (LLM reasoning: "Good improvement. Now increase power to 3 for more candidate diversity,
            and add modulus filter (7,[0,2,5]) to maintain quality.")
Gen 2: Strategy(power=3, filters=[(3,[0,1]),(7,[0,2,5])], bound=7, hits=1) → fitness=1500
```
**Analysis**: Systematic exploration guided by reasoning about parameter effects. Faster to good solution.

## 5. Connection to Broader Machine Learning Theory

### 5.1 No Free Lunch Theorem

**Wolpert & Macready (1997)**: "Any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems."

**Implication**: LLM-guided evolution won't universally outperform rule-based. Success depends on problem structure.

**Our position**: GNFS parameter optimization has structure (smoothness, modular arithmetic patterns) that LLMs may exploit. Not a random black-box function.

### 5.2 Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff

**Multi-Armed Bandit Framework**:
- **Exploration**: Try diverse strategies to find global optimum
- **Exploitation**: Refine best-known strategy to reach local optimum

**Rule-based evolution**: Fixed exploration rate (mutation rate = 0.5 throughout)

**LLM-guided evolution**: Adaptive via temperature scaling
- Early generations (gen 0-5): Temperature 1.2 → High randomness → Exploration
- Late generations (gen 15-20): Temperature 0.8 → Low randomness → Exploitation

**Theoretical advantage**: Matches optimal UCB1 policy for stochastic bandits (Auer et al., 2002).

### 5.3 Fitness Landscape Analysis

**Kauffman's NK Model** (1993): Fitness landscapes characterized by:
- N: Number of parameters (our case: N=5)
- K: Number of parameter interactions (our case: K≈2-3 based on section 4.2)

**Prediction from NK theory**:
- K=0 (no interactions): Random search optimal, evolution provides no benefit
- K=N (full interactions): Landscape fully rugged, evolution stuck in local optima
- K=2-3 (moderate interactions): "Goldilocks zone" where evolution finds good solutions

**Our hypothesis**: GNFS parameter space has K=2-3, favorable for evolutionary search.

## 6. Limitations & Scope

### 6.1 Generalization Limitations

**This study does NOT validate**:
1. **Different target numbers**: Only tested on N=961730063 (30-bit number)
   - Real GNFS targets 512-2048 bit numbers
   - Parameter distributions may differ for larger N

2. **Real GNFS factorization**: Simplified simulation, not production NFS implementation
   - Missing: polynomial selection, linear algebra, square root phases
   - Fitness = smooth candidates found, NOT time to factor

3. **Other evolutionary algorithms**: Only comparing LLM-guided vs rule-based mutation
   - Not testing: Differential Evolution, CMA-ES, Bayesian Optimization
   - Not testing: Ensemble methods, meta-learning baselines

### 6.2 LLM-Specific Limitations

**Model dependency**:
- Results specific to Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (October 2024)
- Different LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) may perform differently
- Future model updates may change behavior

**Prompt engineering**:
- Mutation quality depends on prompt design (currently hand-crafted)
- No systematic prompt optimization performed
- Possible ceiling effect: Better prompts → Better results

**API reliability**:
- Network latency, rate limits, occasional failures
- Not suitable for production GNFS (require offline capability)

### 6.3 Evaluation Metric Limitations

**Smoothness ≠ Factorization Success**:
- Finding many smooth numbers ≠ finding useful relations
- Real GNFS requires:
  - Smoothness over BOTH rational and algebraic sides
  - Linear independence of relations
  - Coverage of factor base

**Timing-based evaluation**:
- Fixed duration (0.5-1.0s) introduces variance (±5%)
- May favor strategies with fast filtering over thorough smoothness checking
- Not measuring end-to-end factorization time

### 6.4 Statistical Limitations

**Sample size**:
- n=15 for LLM runs → Power ~0.65 for d=0.5 (medium effect)
- May fail to detect small effects (d<0.5)
- CI width ~±0.5σ → Imprecise effect size estimates

**Single factor at a time**:
- Not testing: LLM × Meta-learning × Population size interactions
- Requires full factorial design (expensive)

**Theoretical motivation**:
- GNFS parameter space is large (10⁷-10⁹ combinations), discrete, and has moderate parameter interactions (K≈2-3)
- Evolutionary algorithms well-suited for such landscapes
- LLMs may provide semantic reasoning to guide mutations more effectively than random changes
